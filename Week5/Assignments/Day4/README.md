### Stretch Tasks

- [ ] Implement paging on `Index`


## Details

Implement an MVC app from start to finish. Here's a user story for the app:

> Sally wants to host coding experience evenings, and she wants to keep track of the number of people that are attending each one. After she sets one up, she wants to be able to send a link out to her mailing lists. This link should show the event, any details tied to the event, and show the _number_ of people attending.



### Stretch Tasks

There are a lot of opportunities to improve the app. A couple suggestions are:

- Split the Index view up into pages, so that only 10 events are shown at a time

## Hints

MSDN has some helpful articles on paging and user authentication. You might want to try searching for `mvc razor paging` as a starting point.
