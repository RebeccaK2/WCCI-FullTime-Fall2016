- Problems/Projects
  - For tonight's homework, take a website you like, and write a brief report (3-4 paragraphs) on how you feel MVC might be 
    implemented into that website. And how each one of the parts of MVC comes into play. Not for the whole website but for a section 
    or specific piece of functionality.
